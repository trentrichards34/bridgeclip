# Security policy

Security fixes target the latest supported macOS release and the current `main` branch. Older builds may need to update before receiving a fix.

Please report a suspected vulnerability through [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/trentrichards34/bridgeclip/security/advisories/new). Do not include exploit details, provider keys, private videos, or diagnostic logs in a public issue. Include the affected version, steps to reproduce with dummy data, and expected impact. Maintainers will coordinate a private response and disclosure with you.

CreatorClips stores provider keys using Electron secure storage, runs the clipping pipeline locally, and calls ElevenLabs and OpenRouter with the user's own accounts. Review [the data flow](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) when assessing a report. If private reporting is unavailable, open a public issue requesting a private contact channel without vulnerability details.
